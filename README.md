# 01-Single-Price-Grid-Component

Grid Component Challenge

What I learned:

- When dealing with grid overflow because of min-width values set the width on grid-container to 100%.

- Dealing with large fonts means dealing with large margins. Always check if it is the margin causing issues.

- If padding is causing issues with border radius use overflow: hidden.
